### Push_Swap Project - School 42 Berlin (June 2024)

Hi! It is the project `"push_swap"` made by Maryna Peshko at school 42 Berlin in June 2024.

Subject says: "This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting."

The program does not return sorted stack, but a list of operations that have been made.

For my project, I chose Mechanical Turk algorithm, which is very efficient and well-explained in the article of A. Yigit Ogun (Hellibronn)
https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97

I use only two types of instructions - case of both rotations and case of both reverse rotations. Although I have to variations of these instruction - for sorting in descending order (stack b) and for sorting in ascending order (stack a).

#### The valid inputs:
1) ./push_swap 5 4 3 2 1
2) ./push_swap "5 4 3 2 1"
__________________________________________________________________________________

#### To count the number of operations use this command:

./push_swap 5 4 3 2 1 | wc -l 
__________________________________________________________________________________

List of errors.
$? command to display exit status.

Error 1 in case there was no input.
Error 2 in case of input is only one argument and it contains not only digits.
Error 3 in case the input consists of mix of arguments and strings, for example,
4 3 -200 "-66 0" 3
Error 4 in case of error of stack a of the stack has duplicates.
Error 5 when memory allocation are failed.
Error 127 - error during atoi - invalid number.

Returns 0 when success.
